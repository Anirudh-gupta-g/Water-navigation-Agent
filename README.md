### **Project Title:** Water Channel Navigation Agent for Flood Prevention in Chennai

### **Project Overview:**
This project involves the development of an intelligent agent capable of navigating a network of water channels designed to prevent floods in Chennai. The city's water channels are interconnected, with each channel acting as a pathway for water flow, leading to the sea. The project focuses on two main tasks: finding the shortest path for water discharge from a designated start location to the sea and planning efficient inspection routes for maintenance crews.

### **Objectives:**
1. **Shortest Path Calculation:**
   - Develop an algorithm to find the shortest path from a designated water discharge start location (source node) to the sea (destination node). This is crucial for emergency response during potential flood situations.

2. **Route Planning for Inspection and Maintenance:**
   - Create an efficient route planning system for inspection and maintenance crews to ensure they visit every location in the network at least once. This ensures the health and safety of the water channel system.

### **Algorithms Used:**
1. **A* Search Algorithm:**
   - A well-known informed search algorithm used to find the shortest path from the source node to the destination node in the water channel network.

2. **Random Restart Hill Climbing:**
   - A local search algorithm used to explore the solution space for route planning, restarting randomly to avoid local optima and ensure a more thorough exploration.

### **Problem Statement:**
The city of Chennai has designed a network of water channels to manage flood risks. Each location within the network has gates to regulate water flow, and only one gate leading to the sea can be open at a time. The network is represented as a graph, with locations as nodes and channels as edges. The channels are unidirectional, meaning water can only flow in one direction.

### **Key Tasks:**
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Define the environment of the agent, detailing how the water channel network is structured and how the agent interacts with this environment.

2. **Heuristic and Fitness Function:**
   - Define appropriate heuristic functions for the A* algorithm and fitness functions for the Random Restart Hill Climbing algorithm to solve the problem effectively.

3. **Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Implement the A* and Random Restart Hill Climbing algorithms using appropriate data structures. The implementation should include the path taken by the agent for both shortest path calculation and route planning.

4. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Analyze and print the space and time complexity of the implemented algorithms to understand their efficiency in solving the problem.

### **Challenges:**
- **Unidirectional Channels:** Managing the flow directionality while ensuring the correct path to the sea is found.
- **Optimal Route Planning:** Efficiently covering all nodes (locations) in the graph for inspection without unnecessary repetitions.

### **Conclusion:**
This project is crucial for the safety and flood management of Chennai by ensuring water is discharged efficiently during emergencies and the water channel network is regularly inspected and maintained. The intelligent agent developed using A* and Random Restart Hill Climbing algorithms will aid in both real-time response and long-term maintenance of the city's flood prevention infrastructure.
